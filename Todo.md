# Humani-Tree

---

## TODO

- [ ] Basic resources
- [ ] Add in humans when there is a shack free

## Resource Chains

- Sticks -> Shack

## Information

- Humans eat food and drink water, if these run out then humans die

## Things I want to add

- Build up the human population
  - 10 humans = Small Group
  - 50 humans = Tribe
  - 150 humans = Small village
  - 300 humans = Village
  - 500 humans = Small Town
  - 1000 humans = Town
- Add in a skill tree to aid in resource collection
- At certain intervals the population will be too large and the cost of improvement will be too great, so we will need to "Split" the population and start a new civ
  - Each split will leave you with 10 humans
  - After splitting and with tech you will be able to trade with your old civ

## Stages
